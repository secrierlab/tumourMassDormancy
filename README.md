# Table of contents

## ApobecEnrichmentAnalysis

This folder contains the code which establishes how the tumour mass dormancy and exhaustion programmes are predictive of enrichment of APOBEC mutational signatures.

- **ApobecEnrich_define.R:** Runs iterations of tSNE and expectation-maximization clustering to create Apobec mutational signature enrichment labels, and compare them to established Apobec enrichment scores.
- **RandomForest_100sims.R:** Creates 100 random forests from balanced APOBEC-enriched/non-enriched samples, evaluates the overall predictive capacity of the models, and details gene importance.
- **RandomForest_exemplary.R:** Creates a single random forest using the method as detailed above, and runs further visualisation, including association with normalised PLG expression (Fig 4F) and the corresponding multidimensional scaling plot (Fig 4G). Finally, runs Wilcoxon tests to determine differences in median expressions between Apobec-enriched/non-enriched samples.
- **Zscore_normalization.R:** Runs standard Z-score normalisation on exemplary FPKM-normalised data.

## FishersExactTest_EnrichmentAnalysis

Within this folder **FishersExactTestAnalysis.R** is used to investigate the links between tumour mass dormancy and specific cancer driver events using a Fisherâ€™s Exact Test enrichment analysis.


## Hypoxia

This folder contains the code for calculating hypoxia signature scores and associating these with tumour mass dormancy categories.

- **Hypoxia_ScoreCalc.R:** Calculates hypoxia scores using the signatures defined by Buffa, West, and Winter, following the procedure detailed by Bhandari et al. Compares the scores calculated here with those determined by Bhandari et al. from a slightly smaller TCGA cohort.
- **Hypoxia_TMDCategories.R:** Displays the varying distributions of Buffa signature hypoxia scores associated with the detailed tumour mass dormancy categories, as well as the shifting proportions of tumour mass dormancy categorisation associated with hypoxia scores at both the pan-cancer and cancer-specific levels.
- **Hypoxia_DormancyCorrelation.R:** Displays correlations between the hypoxia and various tumour mass dormancy-associated scores, as well as creating volcano plots visualising correlations on a cancer-specific basis.

## ImmuneInfiltrationAnalysis

Within this folder **Immune_infiltration_analysis.R** is used to calculate tumour microenvironment cell infiltration scores and their correlation with tumour mass dormancy.

## MutationalSignature_correlations

Within this folder **MutationalSignature_correlations.R** is used to characterise the associations between tumour mass dormancy and various mutational signatures across the TCGA cohort.

## PHATE_analysis

Within this folder **PHATE_analysis.R** is used to perform PHATE dimensionality reduction on the TCGA solid cancer primary tumour samples based on their expression of genes within the tumour mass dormancy and exhaustion programmes.

## ProgrammeScores

Within this folder **ProgrammeScoreCalculation.R** is used to derive the per-sample dormancy, exhaustion and APOBEC programme scores, and **ScoreDistributionAcrossCancers.R** is used to visualise their density distributions.

## Programme_APOBEC_correlation

Within this folder **Programme_APOBEC_correlation.R** is used to visualise the correlation between the mean expression of the AID/APOBEC gene family of enzymes and the dormancy and exhaustion programmes across the TCGA cohort.


## Programme_gene_APOBEC_correlation

Within this folder **Intergene_correlations.R** is used to visualise the correlations between the expression of individual members of the AID/APOBEC gene family and the genes belonging to the tumour mass dormancy and exhaustion programmes.


## Survival

This folder contains the code for conducting survival analysis associated with tumour mass dormancy categorisation.

- **Survival_TMD.R:** Visualises survival curves using the pan-cancer cohort, and as a comparison of early/late stage cancers. Runs Cox proportional hazard models to account for features including age at diagnosis, gender, cancer type, and tumour stage in both binary (early/late) and full (Stage I-IV) modes. Conducts a Fisher's exact test to determine significant differences in tumour mass dormancy between early/late stage cancers.

## TMD_Exhaustion_APOBEC_gene_mut_freq

Within this folder **PatientMutationStatus.R** is used to visualise the frequency of mutations making up the tumour mass dormancy, APOBEC and exhaustion programmes within the TCGA cohort, relative to the most frequently mutated COSMIC cancer drivers.


## TumourMassDormancy_ProliferationApoptosisRatio_relationship

Within this folder **TMD_classification.R** is used to classify TCGA cohort samples into those displaying tumour mass dormancy.


## dndscv_selection_analysis

Within this folder **SelectionAnalysis.R** is used to detect signals of positive selection with primary tumour samples with and without TMD using the dn/ds maximum-likelihood method.
